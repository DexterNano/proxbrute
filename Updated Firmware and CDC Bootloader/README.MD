This is the proxbrute mod by Brad Antoniewicz of Foundstone(https://github.com/brad-anton/proxbrute) ported to the latest Firmware with the CDC bootloader(port by www.legacysecuritygroup.com)

Firmware Dated 9-23-2016

Proxbrute records a valid LF tag(maybe a guest badge) to Bank1(what I used to call Bank2) and then decrements the hex until you find another valid card(maybe with higher privileges for a different door).

Flash the bootloader and fullimage elf files.

A patch is also included in case you want to compile the source yourself.

Instructions for using LF standalone proxbrute mode on the elechouse RDV2 and standard version of the proxmark3 can be found at:
